Founder/CEO
I am a serial entrepreneur in the food & beverage space, and the CEO/Co-founder of ZeroStorefront (formerly Eatgeek). We help restaurants protect their unit economics by tracking customer acquisition cost and lifetime value across marketing channels. For most restaurants, more than half of their marketing spend is wasted. We can measure which channels are really performing, and uncover opportunities for growth.

Prior to ZeroStorefront, I was the Head of Innovation at GrubHub.","Ashutosh Joshi
