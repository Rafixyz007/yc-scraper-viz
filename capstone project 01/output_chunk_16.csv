Founder
In 2015, I became a door-to-door salesperson. Going outside, be it sunny or rainy, I realised how much opportunity was needed for talented people who worked in the front-lines. Before that, I had launched products for the unbanked population in the Americas. After that, I joined Uber Eats to launch it in Brazil, leaving the company as a GM. Most recently, I worked for Loft, a prop tech startup in Brazil, to lead it's the apartment acquisition area in addition to support and BPO.","Bruno Cecatto
