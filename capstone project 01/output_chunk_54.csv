When I was young I already had a fascination for creating and building things. I collected candle stumps from the neighbors, made new candles from these stumps, and then sold those to the same neighbors. 

My grandmother was in a nursing home, I decided to join a lot of evening and night shifts. I needed to know how we can help nurses care for the people we deeply love. I found out they still worked with walkie-talkies and sensors that give 50% false alarms. We need to change this.","Thomas Bakker
