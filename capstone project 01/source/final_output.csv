My last 20 years are in and around data and software. At the first startup I founded, Varada (acq. by Starburst), we created an acceleration engine for data lakes - helping queries run faster on huge amounts of data. Before becoming a founder, I was an early employee at XtremIO (later EMC) - which became the market leader in all-flash-storage. Even before that, I was a computer science and physics nerd. Still am.

Founder
I have been in software for over 20 years, leading technology and engineering, and building products around data. I was the first employee of Implisit, building AI for sales. After being acquired by Salesforce, I led the architecture and engineering of Einstein for Sales.
