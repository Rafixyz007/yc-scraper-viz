Founder
I'm co-founder and CEO of Kernal Biologics, a Cambridge, MA-based biotech startup developing next-generation messenger RNA immunotherapy. Backed by Hummingbird, Amgen, HBM, NASA, and Boeing, Kernal Bio raised more than $30M. Early in my career, I worked at Merck&Co. on the discovery and development of various oncology drugs, including ZEJULA¬Æ, which got FDA approval for ovarian cancer. I hold an executive MBA from MIT Sloan, an M.D. from Hacettepe Univ. and a B.S. in Biology from MIT.","Cafer Ozdemir
