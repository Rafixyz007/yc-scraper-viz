Founder
I've studied naval engineering at USP, in Brazil, in my graduation year I discovered that I liked programming much more than I liked boats! Shortly after as a developer at RevMob I discovered a new passion, creating products.

In 2016 I created my first startup eDoc, a health tech with the mission to optimize inefficiencies in the Brazilian health care market, focusing in patients primary care.

Finally in 2020 I joined the Lexter.ai founding team to try to change the Brazilian lawtech scene.","Guilherme Delai
