I truly believe each one of us has the ability to create the world they want to see. I love working with optimistic and principle-oriented people.

Since 2020 I’ve been building with my best friend. We followed two rules initially 1) Build something we want for ourselves and 2) Make something more ambitious than previously. Since 2021 we added a third rule, 3) Make it a business. To that end we launched Jobsearch.dev, ExportHealth, Zeneca, Consistent, and now work on Instant, the modern Firebase","Stepan Parunashvili
