Founder/CEO
I started coding because my parents didn't let me play video games and I had to learn how to build them myself. 

I grew up being inspired by a lot of web based games that were popular on websites such as addictinggames.com and aromorgames.com.

This is an era that has now passed. 

Now, I am working on Muse so we can reimagine websites as games to make the internet fun once again.

Co-Founder & CEO
Co-founder & CEO of Airbyte.

I’ve been working in data since 2007. In 2011 I join LiveRamp where I was Head of Integrations and Director of Engineering. My team built and scaled over 1,000 data ingestion and distribution connectors to replicate hundreds of TB of data every day. 

After LiveRamp’s acquisition and later IPO (NYSE:RAMP), I joined rideOS as Director of Engineering, again deep in data. There, I realized that all companies are trying to solve the same problem.

Airbyte was born.","John Lafleur
