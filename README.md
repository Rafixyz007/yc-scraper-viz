# yc-scraper-viz

## Problem statement:

[The Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com)
startup directory contains valuable information on thousands of startups, including their industry, location, batch, and other key attributes. However, this data is scattered across multiple web pages and lacks a structured, easily analyzable format. Analysts, researchers, and enthusiasts struggle to extract insights about startup trends, geographic distribution, and sector growth efficiently.

## Project Goals:

### The goal of this project is to:

1. Automate data collection from [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies) using Selenium to scrape company details including name, batch, location, type, founder, status, and team size.

2. Clean and structure the data for analysis (e.g., standardize batch names, handle missing fields, extract founding years).

3. Provide actionable insights via Tableau visualizations, including:

    * Company founding trends over the years.

    * Distribution of companies by batch and status.

    * Top founders by the number of companies founded.

    * Average team size per company status.

    * Distribution of company types across countries.

    * Companies per batch categorized by types.

4. Provide insights into YC startup ecosystem trends for better understanding and decision-making.
   
The project ultimately aims to help investors, analysts, and researchers understand the YC startup ecosystem in terms of growth, sector distribution, and founder impact.
