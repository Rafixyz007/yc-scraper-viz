## Problem Statement

The [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com) startup directory contains valuable information on thousands of startups, including their industry, location, batch, and other key attributes. However, this data is scattered across multiple web pages and lacks a structured, easily analyzable format. Analysts, researchers, and enthusiasts struggle to extract insights about startup trends, geographic distribution, and sector growth efficiently.

## Project Goals

### The goal of this project is to:

1.  **Automate data collection** from [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies) using Selenium to scrape company details including name, batch, location, type, founder, status, and team size.

2.  **Clean and structure the data** for analysis (e.g., standardize batch names, handle missing fields, extract founding years).

3.  **Provide actionable insights** via Tableau visualizations, including:
    * Company founding trends over the years.
    * Distribution of companies by batch and status.
    * Top founders by the number of companies founded.
    * Average team size per company status.
    * Distribution of company types across countries.
    * Companies per batch categorized by types.

4.  **Provide insights** into the YC startup ecosystem trends for better understanding and decision-making.

The project ultimately aims to help investors, analysts, and researchers understand the YC startup ecosystem in terms of growth, sector distribution, and founder impact.
